    - 5m to 3.75m/2.5m/1.25m adapter
    - 3.75m to 2.5m/1.25m adapter
 - Added 3.75m to 2.5m conical "petal" payload bay, with functioning doors

0.3 (2014-12-03) - Beta updates
 - Repainted 5m decoupler to match fuel tank stripes, and have blue triangles.
 - Repainted 5m to 4x 2.5m adapter, to match fuel tank stripes.
 - Repainted 5m to 3.75m fueled adapter tank, to match the other stripes (sensing a theme?)
    - Added external fuel pipes on 5m to 3.75m fueled adapter tank.
 - Rotated engine bell pattern on F5 cluster engine, to match the R5 orientation.
 - Raised center engine bell on F5 cluster, so that all five are mounted at the same height.
 - Added 3.75m and 5m docking ports. (5m port is in "nanolathing" 1000-point tech-tree node)
 - Added "thrust plates" with optional stacking as upper stage clusters with shrouds (with a shared texture):
    - Note: These are in the "nanolathing" 1000-point tech-tree node.
    - Added 3.75m to 5x 1.25m adapter
    - Added 3.75m to 7x 1.25m adapter
    - Added 5m to 8x 1.25 + 1x 2.5m adapter
    - Added 5m to 2x 2.5m adapter

0.2.1 (2014-11-25) - Quick Fix
 - Fixed logo path for SpaceY agency config (for career mode)
 - Changed "F1" engine to have conical size-adapting fairings instead of cylindrical. 

0.2 (2014-11-25) - Beta update
 - Added "Community Tech Tree" support. If CTT is installed:
    - Moves tall 2.5m SRB to "Gigantic Rocketry"
    - Moves R5 (SaturnV-like) engine to "Gigantic Rocketry"
 - Changed sort-order in VAB/SPH menus for SRBs and short tank, so short versions are first. 
    - (requires delete before reinstall of mod, or else you'll get double entries)
 - Added "Ejectatron", equivalent to 10x Sepratron.
 - Added intermediate height fuel tank. 
 - Added 5m & 3.75m external-ring ASAS reaction wheel systems.
 - Added "R1" engine (single from the "R5" SaturnV-like cluster). 
    - More thrust than Mainsail, and a little lighter, but much less efficient, costs more, and doesn't stack.
 - Added "F1" engine (single from the "F5"/"F9" engines clusters).
    - Less efficient and pricier, but more powerful and lighter than the Skipper. Accepts stacking in 2.5m and 3.75m.
 - Slightly improved "R5" engine cluster's efficiency.
 - Reduced the price and research costs of all liquid fuel engines.
 - Repainted fuel tanks, conical size adapters, and engines to be less "busy", and more SaturnV-like. 
    - Slightly increased the "gloss" on tanks, so that the paint has more of a satin finish.
 - Updated TweakScale settings and moved them to a file called "SpaceY-TweakScale.cfg" for easy deletion/modification.

0.1 (2014-11-17) - Initial Beta test version.
